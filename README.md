- üê≥ BytLabs Core Packages Integration
- üê≥ Docker & Docker Compose support
- üß™ Comprehensive testing setup (Unit & Acceptance Tests)
- üìä OpenTelemetry integration
- üîÑ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- üéØ Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture
- üîç Health checks
- üë• Multi-tenant support
- üìù Logging with Serilog

## BytLabs Package Integration

This template leverages BytLabs core packages to ensure consistency and standardization across all microservices:

- **BytLabs.Core**: Common utilities, extensions, and base classes
- **BytLabs.Domain**: DDD building blocks and patterns
- **BytLabs.Infrastructure**: Shared infrastructure components
- **BytLabs.Testing**: Testing utilities and fixtures
- **BytLabs.Observability**: Standardized observability setup
- **BytLabs.GraphQL**: Common GraphQL components and middleware

Using these packages ensures:
- Uniform architecture across all microservices
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Standardized testing approaches
- Common security practices
- Shared domain patterns and building blocks

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MongoDB (or use the provided Docker container)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytlabs/microservice-template.git
cd microservice-template
bash set-project-name.sh
#Here script will prompt for project name
#In project name you can write your project name in PascalCase (eg. OrderManagement)
```

2. Run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The service will be available at:
- HTTP: http://localhost:8080
- HTTPS: https://localhost:8081
- GraphQL Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/graphql/

## Configuration

The application can be configured through various settings files:

1. Main Configuration (`appsettings.json`):
```json
{
  "ObservabilityConfiguration": {
    "CollectorUrl": "http://localhost:4317",
    "ServiceName": "microservice-template",
    "Timeout": 1000
  },
  "MongoDatabaseConfiguration": {
    "DatabaseName": "microserviceTemplate",
    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017?retryWrites=false",
    "UseTransactions": false
  }
}
```

## Development

### Running Tests

Execute all tests using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up bytlabs-microservice-template-tests
```

### GraphQL Client Generation

The template uses StrawberryShake for GraphQL client generation. To update the client:

1. Install the StrawberryShake CLI:
```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

2. Generate the client code:
```bash
dotnet graphql generate
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The template includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Runs all tests
2. Builds the application
3. Publishes NuGet packages
4. Supports different versioning for:
   - Feature branches (alpha versions)
   - Release tags (stable versions)

## Architecture

The solution follows Clean Architecture and DDD principles:

- **API Layer**: GraphQL endpoints, configuration, and middleware
- **Application Layer**: Commands, queries, and application logic
- **Domain Layer**: Aggregates, entities, and domain logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database access, external services integration

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
