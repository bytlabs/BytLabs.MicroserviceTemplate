## BytLabs Package Integration

This template leverages BytLabs [core packages](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) to ensure consistency and standardization across all microservices:

| Package | Description |
|---------|------------|
| [`BytLabs.Domain`](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) | Domain model building blocks |
| [`BytLabs.Application`](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) | CQRS, validation, and application services |
| [`BytLabs.DataAccess`](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) | Data persistence and MongoDB integration |
| [`BytLabs.DataAccess.MongoDB`](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) | Data persistence and MongoDB integration |
| [`BytLabs.Multitenancy`](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) | Multi-tenant infrastructure |
| [`BytLabs.Observability`](https://github.com/bytlabs/BytLabs.BackendPackages) | Monitoring and logging tools |

Using these packages ensures:
- Uniform architecture across all microservices
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Standardized testing approaches
- Common security practices
- Shared domain patterns and building blocks

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MongoDB (or use the provided Docker container)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository from the Template**

   Instead of cloning the repository directly, use the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create your own repository based on the **microservice-template**. This ensures that you have a copy of the template repository to work with.

   - Click the **"Use this template"** button (usually found near the top-right corner of the page).
   - Create your new repository by following the instructions on GitHub.

2. **Clone Your New Repository**

   Once your new repository is created, clone it to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repository.git
   cd your-new-repository
   ```

3. **Run the Project Setup Script**

   To rename the project, run the `set-project-name.sh` script. It will prompt you for a new project name:

   ```bash
   bash set-project-name.sh
   ```

   **Example Input:**
   When prompted, enter the new project name. For example:
   - `Order Management`
   - `Orders`

   The script will automatically update the project name in all relevant files.

4. **Run the application using Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   The service will be available at:
   - HTTP: http://localhost:8080
   - HTTPS: https://localhost:8081
   - GraphQL Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/graphql/

## Development

### Configuration

The application can be configured through various settings files:

1. Main Configuration (`appsettings.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "ObservabilityConfiguration": {
       "CollectorUrl": "http://localhost:4317",
       "ServiceName": "microservice-template",
       "Timeout": 1000
     },
     "MongoDatabaseConfiguration": {
       "DatabaseName": "microserviceTemplate",
       "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017?retryWrites=false",
       "UseTransactions": false
     }
   }
   ```

### Running Tests

Execute all tests using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up bytlabs-microservice-template-tests
```

### GraphQL Client Generation

The template uses StrawberryShake for GraphQL client generation. To update the client:

1. Install the StrawberryShake CLI:

   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore
   ```

2. Generate the client code:

   ```bash
   dotnet graphql generate
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The template includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Runs all tests
2. Builds the application
3. Publishes NuGet packages
4. Supports different versioning for:
   - Feature branches (alpha versions)
   - Release tags (stable versions)

## Architecture

The solution follows Clean Architecture and DDD principles:

- **API Layer**: GraphQL endpoints, configuration, and middleware
- **Application Layer**: Commands, queries, and application logic
- **Domain Layer**: Aggregates, entities, and domain logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database access, external services integration

## Roadmap

We are planning to introduce the following enhancements to the BytLabs Microservice Template:

1. **BytLabs MessageBus Package Integration**:
   - Leverages Dapr's message bus to handle both event-based pub/sub and command-driven point-to-point communication.
   - Facilitates seamless communication for integration events and commands between microservices.
   - Supports the outbox pattern to ensure reliable message delivery and consistency.

2. **Grafana and Prometheus Integration**:
   - Add Docker Compose setup for Grafana and Prometheus to enable monitoring and visualization.

3. **Kubernetes Templates**:
   - Provide Kubernetes manifests for observability, including configurations for metrics and distributed tracing.

4. **REST API and gRPC Interface Examples**:
   - Include examples demonstrating REST API and gRPC interfaces within the template.

5. **BytLabs IdentityService using Keycloak**:
   - Integration with an IdentityService implementation using Keycloak, designed to work seamlessly with this microservice template.

6. **BytLabs IdentityService using IdentityServer**:
   - Integration with an IdentityService implementation using IdentityServer, designed to work seamlessly with this microservice template.

7. **BytLabs Gateway Service**:
   - Integration with a new gateway service using Ocelot, supporting interfaces defined in the microservice template.

8. **BytLabs Aggregator Service**:
   - Integration with a new aggregator service that consolidates data from multiple microservices built with this template.

9. **FileSystem Service**:
   - Integration with a new FileSystem service managing object storage across all cloud providers, implemented as a separate microservice using this template.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue enhancing the BytLabs ecosystem!
